These are the mods for Minecraft Java Edition 1.6 that my brother and I made while following video tutorials by YouthDigital's Mod Design 1 online course in 2015.

The course itself was pretty bad. Geared towards children, the "Java programming" was merely copying and pasting code snippets and changing the numbers as needed.

The files were edited in Eclipse. The textures were made in Gimp.
